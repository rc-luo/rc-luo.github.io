I am excited to be joining [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en) soon as a PhD student, advised by [Dr. Sebastian U. Stich](https://sstich.ch).

PhD Study
======
Currently hoding a bachelor degree, I plan to work there for the first year as [the preparation phase](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/preparatory-phase/), and then the next four years, on the condition that I will have passed the Qualifying Exam, as a PhD candidate. 

My research topic will be around distributed optimization (federated learning) and privacy-preserving machine learning. Our work includes developing new optimization algorithms, theoretically analyzing their properties, as well as testing their performance on public benchmarks. 

CISPA
======
CISPA is an impactful research institute in the field of [information security](https://csrankings.org/#/index?sec&world). It is on the campus of [Saarland university](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html) in [Saarbr√ºcken](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Saarbr%C3%BCcken,+Germany), located on the southwestern boarder of Germany. 

I will relocate there starting this fall. Hope it'll be a pleasant journey.
