I am excited to be joining [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en) soon as a PhD student, advised by [Dr. Sebastian U. Stich](https://sstich.ch).

PhD study
======
Currently hoding a bachelor degree, I plan to work there for the first year as [the preparatory phase](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/preparatory-phase/), and then the next four years, on the condition that I will have passed the Qualifying Exam, as a PhD candidate. 

My research topic will be around distributed optimization (federated learning) and privacy-preserving machine learning. Our work includes developing new optimization algorithms, theoretically analyzing their properties, as well as testing their performance on public benchmarks. 

CISPA
======
CISPA is an [impactful research institute in information security](https://csrankings.org/#/index?sec&world). It is on the campus of [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html) in [Saarbr√ºcken](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Saarbr%C3%BCcken,+Germany/@49.2472967,6.8424529,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4795b152e302c0eb:0x422d4d510db6b80!8m2!3d49.2381697!4d6.997547), located on the southwestern boarder of Germany. 

I will relocate there starting this fall. Hope it'll be a pleasant journey.
