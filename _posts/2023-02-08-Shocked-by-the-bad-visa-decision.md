I still could not believe that this really happened. Yesterday, after half of a year being checked, my visa application is eventually refused by the German Foreign Office.

Re-application
======
I've immediately lost my previous job as a PhD student in CISPA, thanks for terrible decision made by the German Foreign Office. Since I was working on optimization theory (a very very basic, theoretical, and mathematical research project), I firmly believe that such kind of black-box visa decision is definitely a clear mismatch and is terribly wrong!

My career planning has been heavily affected by it, but now, I already have nothing to lose ;)

So, I have to start reapplying since then. And I'm actively looking forward to another new position now~
