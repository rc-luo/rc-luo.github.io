I still could not believe that this really happened. Two days ago, after half of a year being checked, my offer is eventually disapproved by the German Foreign Office, due to their regrettable decision of suspension of research collaboration with Chinese students.

Re-application
======
I've immediately lost my previous job as a PhD student in CISPA, thanks for terrible decision made by the German Foreign Office. Since I was working on optimization theory (a very very basic, theoretical, and mathematical research project), I firmly believe that such kind of black-box decision is definitely a clear mismatch and is terribly wrong!

My career planning has been heavily affected by it, but now, I already have nothing to lose anymore...

So, I have to start reapplying since then. And I'm actively looking forward to another new phd position now~
