I hold a bachelor degree of computer science in [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). And I'm actively looking for a phd position right now. Previously, I had worked as a research intern in HKU on federated learning, and Tencent ARC Lab on transfer learning. I have also been working with [Dr. Sebastian U. Stich](http://sstich.ch) from [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en/) on optimization theory.
