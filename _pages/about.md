I am currently an undergraduate student in Zhejiang University, majoring in computer science. 

My research
======
My research interest lies broadly in machine learning and optimization, and, more particularly, in:
  - Distributed optimization,
  - Statistical learning,
  - Machine learning for real-world scenarios (*e.g.*, medical image analysis).

Highlight
------
I am constantly seeking internship opportunities or other research collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email ;)
