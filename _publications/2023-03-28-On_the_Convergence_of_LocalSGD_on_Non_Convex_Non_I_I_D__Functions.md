*Abstract.* In federated learning (FL), by taking local steps, LocalSGD is a
strong baseline method with significant communication saving in
non-convex optimization [1]. However, the theoretical analysis of
LocalSGD shows quite the opposite result, in which the rate of
LocalSGD can match the rate of MbSGD (without local steps) only
under very strict conditions.

In this work, we showed (for the first time) that: 1. LocalSGD can benefit from Hessian similarity, which yields an improved conditioning. 2. LocalSGD can converge provably faster than MbSGD for a class of non-convex functions.
3. LocalSGD can converge provably faster than MbSGD without dependency on uniform gradient similarity.
